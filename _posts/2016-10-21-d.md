4th year for soybeans to beat corn in terms of profitability.

The biggest factor driving this discrepancy-- COSTS.  A decrease of $60 to $80 
is needed for corn to become as profitable as soybeans.
The cost difference between these costs is currently at about $200 for the 2016
season.  This difference peaked in 2013 at $247.

Break-Even Corn Price = (corn-soybean cost difference + soybean price * soybean yield) / corn yield
