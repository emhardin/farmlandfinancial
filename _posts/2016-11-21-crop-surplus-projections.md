The report reviews the USDA's November WASDE report.  The report projects that 
U.S. stocks of corn will grow from 1.738 billion bushels to 2.403 billion bushels. 
Soybean stocks are expected to grow from 197 million bushels to 480 million bushels.

The report states that there is a general expectation that corn producers will 
reduce acreage by about 3.5 million acres and that acreage for soybeans will 
increase.
