A comparison of today's low price environment compared to the low price 
environment of the 1990's.
The farm bill has moved from a payment based system to a price support system 
by no longer only focusing on prices to considering revenue-- price and yield.
Taking both price and yield into consideration, manages possible over compensation
(when there are price declines but yield increases to manage those lower prices, 
leading to increased revenue) and possible under compensation (when both price
and yield decline).  For example, current price declines of 34% are larger than
the decline in revenue of 22%, offset by the strong level of yields.
