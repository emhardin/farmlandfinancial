With strong supply in the upcoming harvest, there is continual downward pressure
on prices.  Profits are expected to be lower despite lower costs.  Breaking even
considering cash rent prices is looking even more difficult for producers:

"For farmland with an expected corn yield of 200 bushels per acre, cash rents 
would have to be below $218 per acre before farmers would be projected to have a 
non-negative return. A $218 per acre rent is well below current, average levels 
of cash rents."
