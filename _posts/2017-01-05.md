The possibility of easing restriction on agricultural trade with Cuba has the 
possibility of providing up to $600 million dollars in export value said a USDA
ERS representative.  Cuba's imports from all countries average about $1.8 
billion from 2012 to 2014.  Cuba receives most of its imports from the European
Union at about $383 million.  The United States is their second largest 
supplier at about $362 million with Brazil coming in third at $348 million.

As the ag sector sees its profit tighten overall, the pressure to address the 
trade restrictions with Cuba may heighten.
