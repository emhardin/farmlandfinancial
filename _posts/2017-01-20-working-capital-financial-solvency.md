As a complimentary piece to the "Understanding Coverage Ratio, a Measure of the
Ability to Repay Loans" the authors of this article use it as a space to go 
over issues of solvency considering the use of the debt-to-asset ratio, a 
measure of the bank's ownership of a entity's assets.  
Four thresholds of solvency are delineated: (< 0.20), (0.21 - 0.40), 
(0.41 to 0.70) and (> 0.71).  Working capital is the capital used for daily
operations or formally, current assets minus current liabilities.

The debt-to-asset ratio and the ability to cover debt obligations has shown to
be one of the defining issues in previous boom-and-bust cycles in agriculture.
The expansion of debt obligations past manageable bounds has a been a catalyst
in the downturn of the sector.
