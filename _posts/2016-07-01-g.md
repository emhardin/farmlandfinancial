"Revenue variability is a function of 3 factors: (1) variability of price, (2) 
variability of yield, and (3) the correlation between changes in price and 
yield.  The analysis finds that variability of yield is the primary factor 
associated with the higher revenue variability of Kansas farms. The so-called
"natural hedge", which is a negative correlation between price and yield, exists 
but is a much less important factor."
