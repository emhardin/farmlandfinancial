Kathy Baylis reviews ag's role in U.S. trade.  Agriculture is the only sector
that has a trade surplus exporting $129.7 billion in agriculture products and
importing only $113.1 billion.  Trade disputes with China and Mexico are 
especially concerning as they are the U.S.'s largest and third largest export
markets, respectively. 

Increases in agriculture exports has been largely due to trade agreements. Data
shows that following NAFTA, ag exports increased 233% with adjustments for 
inflation.  The author also points out that these agreements not only lower
tariffs but allow for regional integration through regulatory harmonization.
