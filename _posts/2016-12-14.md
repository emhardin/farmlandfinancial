For the first time since the 1980's, farmland prices have fallen for three 
consecutive years in the Midwest.  The article cites a report from Iowa State 
University stating that considering the retreat in land values in the 1980's 
lasted from 1982-1986, we may be in for a few more years of price decline but
they are still positive that the decline will be a "rational and modest correction"
and will not match that of the 1980's.
