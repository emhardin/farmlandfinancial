"The EU referendum has provided a welcome opportunity to scrutinise current 
agricultural policy, and shortcomings in the way poorly managed regulations 
damage the competitiveness of UK farming has been a key concern.

We now have a unique opportunity to shape the regulations governing our farming 
sector for the benefit of UK farming.

We need a regulatory environment that fosters innovation and incentivises the 
development and adoption of new technologies in pest control and crop science."  
\- Nick von Westenholz, chief executive, Crop Protection Association, UK
