Cash rent as a percentage of farmland price is an interesting and informative 
ratio for understanding the relationship between the rent charged and market 
price for farmland.  Meaning what percentage of the market land price is 
dertermined by the income or rent received from the land.  The authors point 
out the issues of some of the ways this measure is used and interpreted, one 
being the use of it as a percentage benchmark stating that the theory behind 
this assumes that "causality runs from farmland returns to land prices and not
the other way around" and the use of the percentage benchmark to determine rent
based on the market price of farmland.  
 
Outlook for the future: The ratio is expected to continue to decline as 
interest rates remain low.
