Report indicates continued lower net farm income and higher lending activity.
Lower cash flow maintains an above average demand for loans to finance operating
expenses. The total volume of lending is 20% higher than the average of the last
20 years and the number of loans orginated increased by 4% from the same quarter
last year. Additionally, the average size of the loan is also increasing.  Loans
greater than $100,000 is now 77% of total volume of non-real estate loans (67%
in 2006).

The use of farm real estate, i.e. farmland, as collateral has also increased
accounting for 22% of collateral on non-real estate loans larger than $250,000. 
Previously, it had been less than 20% and 15% in the previous two years,
respectively.  Increase use of real estate as collateral is an indication of
lenders trying to reduce their risk basis.

Additional interesting indicators of a softened market are a continued uptick in
interest rates on all loan types, delinquency on farm loans increasing slightly,
loan repayment rates decreasing, and increases in the demand for renewals
and extensions on loans.
